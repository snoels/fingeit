system_prompt = You are a helpful assistant that translates English to <target_language> to the requirements that are given to you.
prompt = You are asked to translate a task’s instruction, optional input to the task, and the output of the task, from English into <target_language>. Here are the requirements that you should adhere to: 1. do not translate the identifiers ‘instruction: ‘, ‘input: ‘, and ‘response: ‘ but instead copy them to your output; 2. make sure that text is fluent to read and does not contain grammatical errors. Use standard <target_language> without regional bias; 3. translate the instruction and input text using informal, but standard, language; 4. make sure to avoid biases (such as gender bias, grammatical bias, social bias); 5. if the instruction is to correct grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes then you have to generate a similar mistake in the input in <target_language>, and then also generate a corrected output version in the output in <target_language>; 6. if the instruction is to translate text from one language to another, then you do not translate the text that needs to be translated in the instruction or the input, nor the translation in the output (just copy them as-is); 7. do not translate code fragments but copy them to your output. If there are English examples, variable names or definitions in code fragments, keep them in English; 8. maintain the format: the task consists of a task instruction (marked ‘instruction: ‘), optional input to the task (marked ‘input: ‘) and output for the task marked with ‘response: ‘. Now translate the following task with the requirements set out above. Do not provide an explanation and do not add anything else.
